# Deep_Learning_Notebook_Modelling
This is a short how-to on building and using a convolution neural network (CNN) deep learning model through Jupyter notebooks. The model is to be trained with the well known Fashion MNIST dataset to classify clothing images into the designated categories.
<p>
  1. Build, evaluate or tweak a CNN model on Google Colab <br>
  2. Use the model on a Jupyter container of a prebaked docker image.
 
### 1. Build the model on Colab
<p>
  (a) Assume you have a Google gmail account to start with in order to use Colab and Google Drive. 
<p>
  (b) Load a model builder notebook into Colab. I have already created a notebook named Build_CNN_Fashion_Colab.ipynb and shared it via this link, https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A4wf415wuLsrUOi9jgIGw7X9dcCLFZhz?usp=sharing. Just open this link to refer to the notebook.
<p>
  (c) You are advised to make a copy of the notebook before running through its code cells on Colab.
