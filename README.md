# Deep_Learning_Notebook_Modelling
This is a short how-to on building and using a convolution neural network (CNN) deep learning model through Jupyter notebooks. The model is to be trained with the well known Fashion MNIST dataset to classify clothing images into the designated categories. <br>
1.  Build, evaluate or tweak a CNN model on Google Colab
2.  Use the model on a Jupyter container of a prebaked image.
